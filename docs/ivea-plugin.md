## üìñ About  

**IVEA (Intelligent Vesicle Exocytosis Analysis Platform)** is an open-source **Fiji/ImageJ** plugin that utilizes artificial intelligence to detect and analyze exocytosis events in a variety of cell types.  
IVEA is designed to provide fully automated, high-speed batch analysis using state-of-the-art deep learning models.  

### üî¨ **AI-Powered Exocytosis Detection**  
IVEA integrates advanced **Vision Transformer (ViT)** and **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** neural networks, enabling robust detection of random burst exocytosis events and stationary burst events in neurons.

# üìÇ Plugin Location in ImageJ  

Once installed, IVEA will appear in ImageJ's plugin menu:  

üìÇ **Menu Path:** `Plugins > IVEA`  

IVEA provides multiple analysis modules, each designed for a specific purpose:  

### **Analysis Modules**  

| Module | Functionality |
|--------|--------------|
| **Random Burst Event** | Detects non-stationary, spontaneous exocytosis events using deep learning models. |
| **Stationary Burst Event (Neurons)** | Identifies exocytosis events localized to specific regions in neurons. |
| **Hotspot Area Detection** | Uses K-means clustering and global iterative thresholding to identify active regions. |
| **ROI Multi-Measurement** | Extracts intensity profiles over a time interval for specified **Regions of Interest (ROIs)**. |
| **Data Labeling** | Provides an annotation tool for training datasets used in IVEA's deep learning models. |

# üìÇ IVEA Resources  

Upon installation, IVEA automatically creates a directory named "IVEA Resources" inside the ImageJ Plugins directory.  

### üìÇ Contents of the `IVEA Resources` Folder  
- **Pretrained Deep Learning Models**  
- **IVEA Software Configuration File**  

This folder is essential for storing and managing model weights, ensuring the correct functioning of IVEA‚Äôs AI-based detection system.
